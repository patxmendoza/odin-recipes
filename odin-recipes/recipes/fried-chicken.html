    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy fried chicken is a delicious dish made by coating chicken pieces in a flavorful breading and deep-frying them until they're golden brown and crispy on the outside, while remaining juicy and tender on the inside.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken pieces</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Additional spices and herbs</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or frying oil of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make crispy fried chicken, start by preparing the chicken. You can use bone-in chicken pieces like drumsticks, thighs, or wings, or boneless chicken breasts or tenders. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and any additional spices or herbs you like, such as paprika, garlic powder, or thyme. Let the chicken marinate in the seasoning for about 30 minutes to enhance the flavor.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine all-purpose flour with additional seasonings like salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and any other spices or herbs you prefer. Mix the dry ingredients well to evenly distribute the flavors.</li>
        <li>Dip each piece of seasoned chicken into beaten eggs, ensuring it's fully coated. Then, roll the chicken in the flour mixture, pressing it down gently to create a thick, even coating. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil or any frying oil of your choice in a deep frying pan or Dutch oven. The oil should be heated to about 350-375째F (175-190째C). Carefully place a few chicken pieces in the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the chicken for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking. The chicken is done when it's crispy and golden brown on the outside, and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the chicken to a wire rack or a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. This helps maintain the crispiness of the chicken. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. Serve it hot and enjoy the irresistible combination of crunchy coating and succulent chicken.</li>
    </ol>
